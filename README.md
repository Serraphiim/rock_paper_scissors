Rock, Paper, Scissors Using JS, CSS3, and HTML5
  This is a simple implementation of rock, paper scissors. I built this project while following the curriculum of the The Odin Project.
The first one to 3 points wins!

Motivation
  A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain why the project exists.

Build status
  The build is complete for this implementation.
 
Future upgrades
  In the future I would like to make the game more responsive to different screen sizes and potentially add @media queries. 
  I will also be updating the box modal to include the players scores in the end to make it more clear whether or not you won.


Installation
  Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.
