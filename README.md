<strong>Rock, Paper, Scissors Using JS, CSS3, and HTML5</strong></br>
This is a simple implementation of rock, paper scissors. I built this project while following the curriculum of the The Odin Project.
The first one to 3 points wins!
</br>
<strong>Motivation</strong></br>
A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain why the project exists.

<strong>Build status</strong></br>
The build is complete for this implementation.
</br>
<strong>Future upgrades</strong></br>
In the future I would like to make the game more responsive to different screen sizes and potentially add @media queries. 
I will also be updating the box modal to include the players scores in the end to make it more clear whether or not you won.
</br>
<strong>Installation</strong></br>
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.
